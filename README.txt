For our final project, our team used multiple files as well as several images.
These files and images must be included in order for the game to run.

We have emailed the files to both the TA and Professor Hsiao.
They are also included here: https://github.com/jmotwel/VGDFinal

To run the game and view the start screen, you must download all of the files
from Github or the zip we have sent.  Open the "vgd (2).rdp" file then visit
"http://40.71.169.155/" using Microsoft Edge or Firefox (chrome does not consistently work).
This will display game, showing the starting animation and screen.

All of the code for our game is included in the .pde files.
These files are "camera.pde", "game.pde", "player.pde", "tilemap.pde", and "viewTiles.pde".
