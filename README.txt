For our final project, our team used multiple files as well as several images.
These files and images must be included in order for the game to run.

The necessary files are also included here: https://github.com/jmotwel/VGDFinal

The files are hosted on an Azure Cloud VM. To run 
the game enter http://40.71.169.155/" in the browser using Microsoft Edge or Firefox 
(chrome does not consistently work).
This will display game, showing the starting animation and screen.

All of the code for our game is included in the .pde files.
These files are "camera.pde", "game.pde", "player.pde", "tilemap.pde", and "viewTiles.pde".

Any permissions and credits given for the images and artistic work are inside the atistic credits
text file.

Game Controls:
Currently we only have the game menu and scrolling tilemap implemented. Use the mouse to click
on buttons in the screen. Press the start game button to start the game and the instructions
button to view the instructions. Make sure the game is focused on by clicking on the 400x400
canvas if the controls arent working. Use WSAD to move the player once the game has started.
